RQ: Previous study working on web understanding for LLM focus on managing complex HTML texts, while visual web agents have been overlooked. 

## Strengths

* We introduce WebVoyager (Figure 1), a multimodal web agent designed to autonomously accomplish web tasks online from start to finish, managing the entire process end-to-end without any intermediate human intervention.

* To accurately evaluate the capabilities of web agents in end-to-end task completion, we propose an automated evaluation protocol using GPT-4V. Specifically, we save screenshots throughout the online navigation process and then use GPT-4V to evaluate these trajectories together with the final results automatically.

* Autogenerated dataset using self-instruct. Evaluate webvoyager on other datasets as well.

* Use a visual mask (set-of-masking) to hint the clickable area

* human evaluation of 300 tasks.

## Drawbacks

* while I understand the difficulty in recruiting more participants for human evaluation, I'd like to see all models (not only gpt-4) to be evaluated by humans, as gpt-4 only show a ~60-70% success rate in human evaluation.
