# RAP: Retrieval-Augmented Planning with Contextual Memory for Multimodal LLM Agents

NUS, arxiv preprint

## Motivation:

Reflecting past experiences in current decision-making processes, an innate human behavior, continues to pose significant challenges. Addressing this, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Planning (RAP) framework, designed to dynamically leverage past experiences corresponding to the current situation and context, thereby enhancing agentsâ€™ planning capabilities.

## Strength

* Retrieve related experience as new ICL examples

## Challenges

* lack of comparison between fine-tunning the model on the memory database
