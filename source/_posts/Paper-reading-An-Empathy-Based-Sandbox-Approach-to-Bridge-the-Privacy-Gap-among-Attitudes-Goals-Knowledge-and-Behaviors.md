Risk-free privacy sandbox

## Strength

- Interesting and novel idea
- Strong usecase

## Concerns:

- Mostly on implementation.
- Browsing history – hallucination? And – it may not be effective, as it’s sensitive and can not be read by web apps.
- How did they mimic and use social media posts?
  - they basically can't.

## Idea:

- LLM Agent that impersonates a persona, browse the internet for a while (use real twitter/google accounts, mimic real person behavior), longitudinal
  - But for what?
  - ethical concerns
